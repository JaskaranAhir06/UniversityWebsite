            <h1>A Few Words About the University</h1>
            <p> About   The University
                Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) was established at Ludhiana by an act of the Punjab Legislature No. 16 of 2005 notified in the Punjab Government Gazette on August 9, 2005 and it started functioning w.e.f. April 21, 2006 for promoting livestock production, health and prevention of the disease(s) through integrated teaching, research and extension programme(s).
                
                The University was established with the following goals and objectives:
                To provide adequate supply of trained veterinary professionals including Master’s and Doctorate level specialists capable of handling livestock health and production aspects according to the needs of the State Government and allied agencies.
                To undertake research work in selected areas and wherever applicable following multidisciplinary approach.
                To provide opportunities for continuing education for professionals in Veterinary Science.
                To provide consultancy and specialist services to livestock owners, government, semi-government and allied agencies.
                To run “Referral” hospitals for specialized treatment and also to provide clinical training to the students.
                To provide technical expert advise to different government and other agencies whenever called upon.
                To foster faculty development by providing opportunities to participate in appropriate training programmes, conferences, workshops, seminars, symposia etc. and avail other opportunities in exchange programmes.
                To encourage cooperation and collaboration with other departments, colleges, universities and industries, both nationally and internationally</p>
            <p>An initial pledge of $600,000 (roughly $16 million in today's currency) from oil magnate Jonathan Carroll, along with contributions by the American Baptist Education Society, helped to found the University. The University's land was donated by Marshall Field, owner of the historic Chicago department store that bore his name.</p>

            <p>Christopher Smith, the University's first president, envisioned a university that was "brand new, yet as solid as the ancient hills" - a modern research university, combining an English-style undergraduate college and a German-style graduate research institute. The Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University fulfilled Christopher's dream, quickly becoming a national leader in higher education and research: an institution of scholars unafraid to cross boundaries, share ideas, and ask difficult questions.</p>
            <p>President Smith articulated his hope and vision for the GADVASU at the first faculty meeting in 1888: "The question before us is how to become one in spirit, not necessarily in opinion."</p>
            <p>The University's commitment to answering that question - and many others - continues to guide it today.</p>
